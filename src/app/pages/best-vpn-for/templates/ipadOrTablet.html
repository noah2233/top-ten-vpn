    VPNs have become an increasingly popular tool for internet users to protect their online privacy or access content
    that is restricted in their country. But while many people are aware of the benefits of having a VPN on their
    desktop, it is also worth knowing about the benefits of having a smartphone or tablet VPN – including for iPad.
</p>
<p>Most VPN providers typically offer separate applications for Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and
    iPad. A VPN for iPad works exactly as on any other device, and is configured to work seamlessly on your iPad.

    A VPN for iOS works in the same way as any other VPN, except that it has been configured for use on your iPad or
    iPhone.

<p>If you’re planning to use an iPad VPN, the first thing to do before signing with a specific service provider is to
    make sure they actually have an iPad app (most do). Once you’re satisfied that they cater to iPads, the other major
    considerations are the same as they would be for using VPN on any device: privacy, security, location, price, and
    reliability of service.

<p>
    Most people use a VPN to browse securely and anonymously, and to access geographically restricted content.

    When assessing a VPN provider for privacy and secure connection, you should be looking for the following: use of a
    trusted security protocol, such as OpenVPN or IKEv2/IPsec; a no-logs policy, so you know your usage won’t be
    recorded; and bonus features, such as anti-fingerprinting, which prevents apps and websites learning about your
    online behaviour and serving you customized ads.
</p>
<p>
    As for location, each person has their own considerations. Are you planning to use your VPN to access a server in 1
    location? In that case, all you need to do is make sure your chosen VPN services that location. Or are you a
    frequent traveller who has no idea where they’ll next end up? If this sounds like you, you should be looking at how
    many servers your VPN offers; some boast of thousands of servers in dozens of countries.
</p>
<p>
    Prices tend to only vary slightly between each of the major VPN providers, so it’s worth looking into the finer
    print and seeing which ones are cheaper for your needs: one VPN company might be cheaper for a 1-month subscription,
    while another might be cheapest for a 2-year subscription, and a third might have frequent sales that bring their
    price below all other competitors.
