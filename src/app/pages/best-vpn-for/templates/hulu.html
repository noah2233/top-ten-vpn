    ​For Hulu users, you’ll appreciate the vast array of both Japanese and US-based servers to choose from. And the
    45-day money back trial lets you test drive the service for more than a month to see if it’s a good fit for you.

    Hulu’s subscription video service offers fast streaming for some of the most popular content of today, including
    South Park and original content, such as Casual. This service gives subscribers the ability to view TV shows
    smoothly and whenever they want, and shows are available on Hulu even faster than on some of its competitors
    (Netflix, for example).

    Hulu partners with big names like the Walt Disney Company, BBC, Showtime, and more. The service has also made deals
    with channels like Fox, ABC, and NBC to run its programming immediately after the shows air (as opposed to
    non-subscription services that can only offer the shows a week or so after they’ve aired).

<h4><b>How to Choose a Hulu VPN</b></h4>
<p>With so much quality content riding on a subscription, it’s not surprising that Hulu has such a wide fan base.
    There’s one problem though—geofilters. A geofilter blocks content streaming when you are outside the geographic
    parameters defined by the service. In the case of Hulu, anyone outside the US or Japan won’t be able to access their
    favorite television shows, even if you have an account.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s an easy way around all of these restrictions. VPNs are services that set up a virtual private
    network. These networks allow you to connect to your Hulu account without disclosing your actual location. It’s a
    smart fix, and best of all it works. Set up a Hulu VPN, and you can be streaming your weekly programming within
    minutes.</p>
<h4><b>How to Setup a VPN for Hulu</b></h4>
<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to disable IPv6, a step we’ve detailed in a section below.</p>
<p>
    Note: Even when you use the best VPNs that work for Hulu, not all of their servers will connect to Hulu
    successfully. Most of the time you’ll have to speak to customer service to find out which servers are specifically
    capable of bypassing Hulu firewalls. That’s why you need a service with good customer support, something that all of
    the services mentioned above offer.

        How to Disable IPv6
    </b>
</h4>
<p>
    Because even the best VPNs for Hulu won't hide your IPv6 (only your IPv4 addresses), you'll need to disable these in
    order for your virtual private network workaround to be successful. The good news is that this is super simple.
    Here's how to disable IPv6 for Windows 10 (this should be done before connecting to the VPN. If you're already
    connected, disconnect, close your app, and then proceed):
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Activate the Run prompt by holding down Win Key+R</li>
    <li>Open Network Connections by typing in ncpa.cpl and press enter</li>
    <li>Right click on the connection you're using to connect to the internet and find the Properties option</li>
    <li>Find the option for Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and uncheck the box</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Don't forget to save changes. Next, you have to update these changes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Type Win Key+R to open the Command Prompt. You’ll be asked if it’s all right for the program to make changes,
        and you should click yes.</li>
    <li>A black screen will appear. Type ipconfig/flushdns, and press enter.</li>
    <li>You’re done.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now, you can reconnect to your VPN, connect to Hulu, and stream away.
</p>
<p>
    If you are running MacOS, then follow these instructions to disable IPv6:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Disconnect and close your VPN as before.</li>
    <li>Open your System Preferences in the menu bar, select Network, AirPort, and Advanced in that order.</li>
    <li>Select TCP/IP and Configure IPv6. When the menu pops up, choose Off.</li>
    <li>Apply changes, and reconnect to your VPN.</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Paying for Hulu Outside US and Japan</b></h4>
<p>As we said, Hulu is pretty tough on its geo-restrictions. In addition to requiring an IP address in the US or Japan,
    Hulu members must also pay for their subscriptions with a payment method linked to 1 of these 2 countries. What do
    you do if you don’t have an American or Japanese credit card? Here are a few options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use prepaid cards such as Amazon gift cards or the like</li>
    <li>Use EntroPay to set up a PayPal account, which can then be used to pay for your Hulu account directly</li>
    <li>Bitcoins</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>The 5 Best VPNs for Hulu</b></h4>
<p>
    While they all appear to be the same on the outside, don’t be fooled into thinking that all VPNs will deliver the
    same results. If you want quality streaming, solid security, and the kind of privacy that will keep snoopers at bay,
    you’ll need to subscribe to a top-notch service that provides these kinds of features.
</p>
<p>
    What’s more, Hulu has some pretty advanced security features, so a standard VPN won't work to get around its
    geoblocks. You’ll need a resilient VPN that has dedicated servers with IP addresses that Hulu doesn’t recognize in
    order to bypass the security features. Here are 5 of the best VPNs for Hulu streaming today:
