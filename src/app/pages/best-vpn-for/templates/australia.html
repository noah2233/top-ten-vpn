    Whether you live in Australia or are just visiting, the best thing you can do to protect your online privacy and
    access content from around the world is to use a VPN, or virtual private network.
</p>
<h4><b>Why do you need a VPN for Australia?</b></h4>
<p>
    Few Australians realize it, but the authorities have the power to instruct your internet service provider (ISP) to
    hand over certain information about internet users, such as the IP address the user was connected to at the time of
    sending or receiving communications. In 2015-16, the various law enforcement agencies made more than 300,000
    authorizations for the disclosure of historical telecommunications data, including IP addresses. While you generally
    have nothing to fear if youâ€™re not committing a crime, the only way of protecting yourself against potential
    snooping by the government or anyone else is to use a VPN.

    Another benefit of using a VPN for Australia is that it can get you around geo-blocking restrictions. Many streaming
    services, such as Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu restrict certain content to Australian viewers. With a VPN, you can
    connect to a server in the US, UK or elsewhere while being physically in Australia, and these services will treat
    you as if you were viewing from LA, London or Delhi and not from Sydney, Melbourne, or Alice.

<h4><b>Using a VPN to Stream Live Sport</b></h4>
<p>You would have thought that by 2018, live sporting matches from the top leagues and tournaments around the world
    would be available to everyone regardless of where they live. Sadly, this still isn&rsquo;t the case, and the only
    way to get access to certain content is with a VPN. If you&rsquo;re looking for an all-around pass that offers you
    access to all the best sporting action from around the world, including NBA, NFL, NHL, NCAA basketball, English
    Premier League, and <a style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"

    and the <a href="/best-vpns-for-bbc-iplayer">BBC iPlayer</a> &ndash; just to

    a few. With a VPN, you can circumvent any geo-blocking restrictions imposed on Australian sports fans by these
    services.</p>
<h4><b>Is it Legal to Use a VPN in Australia?</b></h4>
<p>It is 100% legal to use a VPN in Australia. It is also legal to use a VPN to stream content from overseas, as Prime
    Minister Turnbull confirmed in a recent statement on <a
        href="https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/second-reading-copyright-amendment-online-infringement-bill-2015">his
        website</a>: &ldquo;The Copyright Act does not make it illegal to use a VPN to access overseas content. While
    content providers often have in place international commercial arrangements to protect copyright in different
    countries or regions, which can result in &lsquo;geo-blocking&rsquo;, circumventing this is not illegal under the
    Copyright Act.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>How to Choose the Best Australia VPN?</b></h4>
<p>When choosing a VPN for use in Australia, you should look out for providers that promise the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Zero-logging policy, meaning the VPN provider doesn&rsquo;t keep any records whatsoever of your IP and
            browsing history.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Servers in the countries where your favorite content is aired. For example, if you&rsquo;re looking to access
            content that is aired only in the U.S., you&rsquo;ll want a VPN provider that offers multiple American
            servers for you to choose from.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Super-fast speeds that make the National Broadband Network seem relatively slow in comparison.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>A free trial period or 30+-day money-back guarantee, so you can <a href="https://speedtestvpn.com/">test out
                the speeds</a> without paying a cent.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
