    While torrenting is an extremely efficient and fast way to download large files, doing it safely and securely can be
    problematic. Unfortunately, torrenting has become somewhat synonymous with internet piracy; and internet service
    providers (ISPs) and government authorities are all over it.

    Thankfully, this doesn’t have to spell the end of torrenting for you. In fact, you can keep torrenting safely and
    anonymously - and even improve the overall experience - by using a VPN.
</p>
<p>
    But how do you choose a torrent VPN? And which are the best ones around?
</p>
<p>
    Read on and we'll answer your questions about torrenting.
</p>
<h4><b>Is Torrenting Legal?</b></h4>
<p>Torrenting itself is perfectly legal. And there is nothing at all wrong or illegal in sharing files with other users
    via torrents, either. The problem only arises if you use torrents to share (such as with Peer-to-Peer sharing) and
    download copyrighted files - movies, music and software, for instance - without getting the copyright owner’s
    permission.</p>
<p>To put it in context, the creators of software such as OpenOffice and VLC player have made their products available
    to the general public free of charge. This means downloading them via a torrenting site is completely legitimate. On
    the other hand, the owners of The Beatles’ discography have made it available only if you purchase it, so
    downloading it for free via a torrenting site is against the law.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because it’s used to break the law in this way, torrenting has gained a bad reputation. Many ISPs
    monitor torrenting websites; and some may throttle your connection or block you altogether if you try to log on to
    them - even if your intentions are completely legitimate. This is why using a VPN for torrenting is such a great
    idea.</p>
<p>A VPN encrypts your data transfers and hides your IP address, replacing it with an anonymous one. This makes it
    impossible for your ISP to know what you’re doing online. What’s more, by connecting to a VPN server, you’ll be able
    to bypass both speed and content restrictions imposed by your location and your ISP. As a result, you’ll be able to
    access more content and download it much faster, improving your overall experience.</p>
<h4><b>What You Should Look For In a VPN for Torrenting</b></h4>
<p>
    There are three main things you should look out for if you plan on using a VPN for torrenting: privacy, server
    availability and speed. Let’s consider each in turn.
</p>
<h5><b>Privacy</b></h5>
<p>When you’re torrenting, privacy is paramount. Ideally, a VPN for torrenting will have the following privacy features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A firm no logging policy, which ensures it doesn’t keep any information on your internet usage and activity;
    </li>
    <li>Strong encryption - ideally 256-bit using OpenVPN, the most popular and secure internet security protocol; and
    </li>
    <li>Numerous anonymous IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Server availability</b></h5>
<p>
    The more servers a VPN service has, the better, for two reasons. Firstly, having a large number of servers ensures
    you can always find a server with a reasonably low load, even during peak times. This, in turn, means you can carry
    on with your downloads throughout the day, without having to worry about running into performance issues.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, the more servers a VPN has in different countries, the easier it is to unblock geographically restricted
    content. As a plus, you can also take your VPN with you when you travel, safe in the knowledge that you’ll always
    find a fast server nearby.
</p>
<h5><b>Speed</b></h5>
<p>
    Of course, if you’re downloading files, speed is paramount. Look for VPNs with no bandwidth restrictions, no speed
    caps, and premium servers that are continually monitored to ensure optimal performance.
</p>
<p>
    Some VPNs also have special add-ons designed to boost your internet connection speed, as well as other features
    tailored specifically for torrenting. Port forwarding, for instance, allows you to open special pathways - called
    ports - specifically for torrent traffic, further improving your internet speed.
