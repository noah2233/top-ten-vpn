<h4><b>What is a VPN for Business?
    </b></h4>
<p>
    VPNs are used for many recreational reasons, but businesses are beginning to understand their benefits as well. A
    VPN for business is the same thing as a regular VPN and provides security, convenience, and accessibility to those
    who are connected. For those who aren’t aware, a VPN is a virtual private network. It creates a private connection
    between users so that you can connect remotely and share information securely.
</p>
<h4><b>Why Businesses Need a VPN
    </b></h4>
<p>
    Companies of every size need VPNs to conduct their business today for several reasons:
</p>
<img class="w100p" src="{{mainImage}}" alt="">
<h5><b>To connect to a network remotely
    </b></h5>
<p>
    With telecommuting and out-of-office work hours on the rise, a VPN allows employees to connect to the company’s
    private network from anywhere, and at any time. While most systems will allow you to connect regardless of what type
    of connection you use, the added benefit of a VPN is that your connection remains secure. This means important and
    sensitive documents and information being shared, viewed, and sent over the network will remain secure and hidden. A
    secure VPN lets employees get in some after-hours work without compromising security. This also helps employees
    continue their work schedule even while traveling.
</p>
<h5><b>For security, while connected via a public WiFi network
    </b></h5>
<p>If you’re out on a business lunch, trying to get in a few last minute emails at the airport, or getting work done
    while connecting to a public WiFi network for any other reason, a VPN keeps these communications encrypted and
    secure as well. This includes browsing activity as well as information that is physically present on your computer
    or mobile device.
</p>
<h5><b>To circumvent geo-restrictions
    </b></h5>
<p>If you're in an industry that requires you to access geo-blocked sites or material, a VPN is a good workaround.
    Journalists, for example, can connect to blocked websites that are being censored or restricted to or from a certain
    location.
</p>
<h5><b>To connect teams globally
    </b></h5>
<p>
    If you have multiple branches or offices in various locations, a VPN is an easy way to connect teams, branches, or
    team members. The VPN provides a secure channel for sharing documents and information while making collaboration
    easier for everyone.
</p>
<h4><b>What to Look for in a Business VPN
    </b></h4>
<p>
    As you can see, there are so many reasons a business needs a VPN, but you don’t want to sign up for the first brand
    you see. In order to get quality service, there are a few things to look out for, including:
</p>
<h5><b>Server locations
    </b></h5>
<p>
    The more and the closer the server is to you, the faster and better the VPN service you’ll get. So, a company that
    offers server locations close to you should weigh more heavily in your comparison than one that does not. This is
    also important if you are specifically trying to give the impression that your business is in a particular
    geographic location. For example, if your customer service team is located in Singapore, but you want your customers
    to believe they are in the US, you'll need a VPN that has American servers to provide that type of IP address. Also,
    if you are trying to unlock a geo-restriction, make sure that service has servers in the location that is not
    blocked.
</p>
<h5><b>Bandwidth limitations
    </b></h5>
<p>
    If you are downloading or transferring large files, you’ll need as much bandwidth as you can get. A site that limits
    your bandwidth will stall your progress, something that many businesses can’t afford (and shouldn’t accept from a
    VPN service).
</p>
<h5><b>Speed and any limitations
    </b></h5>
<p>
    As with bandwidth, speed is essential for fast and smooth business communications. Check with the service provider
    prior to signing up to see what their average daily speeds are and if any limits apply.
</p>
<h5><b>Security features
    </b></h5>
<p>
    Since you’re doing business over the network, you’re likely sending and receiving sensitive information all the
    time. Because of this, you need to find a VPN that provides maximum security. This may include secure privacy
    policies like no activity logging, firewalls, and encryption.
</p>
<h4><b>Different VPN Considerations of Small, Medium, and Large Businesses
    </b></h4>
<p>
    Of course, not all businesses have the same needs. Small businesses that only do a nominal amount of network
    communication will only need a limited amount of bandwidth. If your business only has one location and does a
    smaller number of transactions, you probably don’t want to pay for a more robust service and all the frills.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, a larger business that does a heavy amount of business will need more bandwidth and speed to
    accommodate the workload. Larger businesses may also want to invest in better security features.
