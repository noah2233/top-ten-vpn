    More than 200 million people around the world use Telegram regularly to send private, secure, and encrypted messages
    through their smartphones, tablets, or computers. Because of its strong security credentials, some authoritarian
    governments have viewed Telegram to be a threat and have ordered it blocked in their countries. Fortunately, there
    is a way around such restrictions: you guessed it, a virtual private network, or VPN.

<h4><b>What is VPN for Telegram?</b></h4>
<p>
    VPN​s offer users security and anonymity, providing an encrypted connection between the user’s device and the
    internet and concealing their real IP address. VPNs also allow you to bypass geographic restrictions by logging on
    from a remote server in a different location from the one where the user is physically located. This makes VPNs
    perfect for using Telegram in restricted countries. In Russia and want to use Telegram? Simply log on to a VPN
    server in any country where Telegram isn’t blocked (such as the US) and start messaging.
</p>
<h4><b>How to Use a VPN to Unblock Telegram
    </b></h4>
<p>
    A VPN can be used on all the same devices and operating systems that Telegram can be used, namely: Android, iOS​,
    and Windows for smartphones and tablets; and PC, Mac, MacOS, and Linux for desktop. This makes Telegram accessible
    virtually anywhere—while at home, traveling, in the office, or anywhere else—and it also makes VPN for Telegram a
    viable option for any device or in any location.
</p>
<p>
    Using a VPN to unblock Telegram requires 2 steps: the first is logging on to a remote VPN server; the second is
    accessing Telegram.
</p>
<p>To use a VPN:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sign up to your chosen VPN (such as the top 5 VPNs for Telegram listed below).</li>
    <li>Install the VPN provider’s client to your preferred device or devices (some VPN providers allow you to log in to
        as many as 6 devices with 1 account).</li>
    <li>Configure your VPN settings.</li>
    <li>Log on to a server in a country where Telegram isn’t blocked (i.e. anywhere aside from the authoritarian regimes
        listed in the section below).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once you’ve logged into your remote server, you’re free to log in to Telegram and start messaging your friends.
</p>
<h4><b>Where is Telegram Blocked?</b></h4>
<p>
    Telegram is blocked in many of the usual countries that tend to block online communications services that don’t bow
    to their authoritarian laws. As of the time of writing, this included the following countries:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/best-vpns-for-russia">Russia</a></li>
    <li><a href="/best-vpns-for-china">China</a></li>
    <li>Saudi Arabia</li>
    <li>Iran</li>
    <li>North Korea (although let’s be honest, pretty much the entire internet is blocked in North Korea).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At time of writing, Telegram was still available in Turkey, Azerbaijan and a handful of other countries that
    routinely block access to communications and social media services like YouTube and Facebook. The problem with the
    countries that tend to block access to certain internet sites is that they often do so with very little notice.
    Therefore, the only way to prevent a situation in which you’re suddenly blocked from Telegram is to have a VPN
    account ready.
</p>
<h4><b>Is Telegram as Secure as It's Hyped up to Be?
    </b></h4>
<p>
    Telegram advertises the following security features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Messages are heavily encrypted</li>
    <li>It is cloud-based, allowing you to access messages from multiple devices</li>
    <li>Servers are spread worldwide for security and speed</li>
    <li>Messages are safe from hacker attacks</li>
    <li>Users can self-destruct their messages with a timer</li>
    <li>Users can send personal and business secrets in a secret chat mode</li>
    <li>Source code and protocol (MTProto) is open for review by everyone, making it more transparent than WhatsApp</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Despite the ongoing debate over Telegram’s and WhatsApp’s security credentials, the truth is that no messaging app
    is 100% secure. Various analyses have shown that Telegram is not immune to security vulnerabilities. Moreover, some
    users may not be aware that certain Telegram settings aren’t switched on automatically; for example, users must go
    into the settings and enable secret chat if they wish to add extra encryption to sensitive messages.
</p>
<p>
    Whether you’re in a country where Telegram is blocked or a country where Telegram is free and openly available, a
    VPN provides an added layer of security: it conceals your real IP address, allowing you to bypass any geolocation
    restrictions and message with anonymity.
