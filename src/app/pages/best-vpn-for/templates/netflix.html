    If you think about it, it’s pretty stunning how different watching TV was just about a decade ago, before Netflix
    streaming changed the game. Today, you have countless options for great dramas, comedies, documentaries and more,
    just a click away - and always when and how you want it.

    If you’re a Netflix novice, or even a veteran, you can benefit from using a VPN when using Netflix. In this article,
    we lay out the reasons why using a VPN with Netflix is a must, and list the providers who are best for this purpose.
    We also explain how to get a VPN up and running in 5 simple steps.
</p>
<h4><b>Why Use a VPN for Netflix?</b></h4>
<p>
    Another major benefit of VPNs - and this is where Netflix comes in - is that they allow you to change the location
    of your computer so you can watch content that might not be available in your country.
</p>
<p>
    Even in countries where Netflix is available, not everybody gets the same selection. The Netflix catalog in the US
    is by far the largest, and if you’re overseas, you might not have access to many of the same TV shows and movies due
    to copyright and licensing restrictions.
</p>
<p>
    With the right VPN you can sidestep this restriction and get all the same content as your buddies back stateside -
    at the exact same time - so you can stop worrying about spoilers.

<h4>
    <b>Better Streaming Quality with VPNs</b>
</h4>
<p>
    When you’re streaming movies and TV online, speed is crucial. Some internet service providers (ISPs) monitor your
    activity and slow streaming traffic, which can affect the user experience. With a VPN, you can sidestep the ISP,
    disabling their ability to slow you down.

        What is the Netflix VPN Ban?

    This is where we should probably note that Netflix has thought of this too. The company blocks a number of VPNs, at
    the request of copyright holders who don't want viewers getting around the restriction. Because the company has to
    work out distribution, licensing, and copyright agreements for each country, it’s in Netflix’s interests to stop VPN
    users, and the company has the resources and know-how to bedevil most VPN companies.
</p>
<p>
    Beginning in January 2016, Netflix set up one of the best VPN detection systems anywhere, making it much harder to
    use a VPN to access Netflix content. Users trying to access geo-blocked content have been hit by proxy errors, and
    many have resigned themselves to just waiting until their local Netflix provides the content that people in the US
    and elsewhere take for granted.
</p>
<p>
    This complicated matters for a lot of VPN producers, except for those able to stay one step ahead of Netflix.
