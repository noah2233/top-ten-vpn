    Twitter is one of the world’s most popular social networks, so it may seem hard to believe that access to it is
    often restricted. Whether it’s restricted by private enterprises like universities that want students to focus on
    their studies, or entire countries that seek to stifle political conversation, would-be tweeters often find that
    they aren’t even able to log onto the website, let alone post anything.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, when anything is geo-blocked (blocked based on your location), there’s a way to get around it. That way
    is a VPN.
</p>
<p>
    VPNs have 2 main functions: Added security and obscuring your location. The way they do this is by encrypting
    traffic flowing to and from your device, making it go through an intermediary server. This adds a level of
    protection and also hides your location.
</p>
<p>
    This means that if you’re at work and management decides to block Twitter, you can use a VPN to give you a new IP
    address and circumvent your employer’s stonewall. Or if you’re travelling in a country in which Twitter is banned,
    you can use your VPN to access the site and stay up-to-date about the latest breaking news.
</p>
<p>
    While you may not feel the need to use your VPN all the time, buying it and installing it on your devices will
    ensure that you’ll be able to use it when you do need it.

<h4><b>How to Use a VPN to Unblock Twitter</b></h4>
<p>
    The exact steps you take to use a VPN to unblock Twitter will depend on which VPN you choose. The main idea,
    however, is the same, and in theory it’s fairly simple and straightforward.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Purchase your VPN of choice, download and install it on your device(s), guided by user
    prompts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open the VPN, connect to server. You’ll have the choice of choosing servers in a variety of
    countries; choose a country, like the U.S., that doesn’t block Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Once you connect to a server in an open country, you can then go to Twitter and should have
    immediate access.</p>
<h4><b>Where is Twitter Blocked?</b></h4>
<p>
    It’s true, the entire site of Twitter is only blocked in 3 countries: China, Iran, and North Korea. But many more
    countries, at one point or another, have blocked the entire site for a certain amount of time, or blocked/continue
    to block certain accounts continuously. While some of the countries on this list won’t surprise you, others will:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Egypt</li>
    <li>France</li>
    <li>Israel</li>
    <li>India</li>
    <li>Pakistan</li>
    <li>Russia</li>
    <li>South Korea</li>
    <li>Turkey</li>
    <li>United Arab Emirates</li>
    <li>Venezuela</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As you can see, many countries have resorted to blocking at least some Twitter accounts temporarily or permanently,
    often during times of political unrest, like the Arab Spring. And it’s specifically during these times when people
    want access to the site that’s viewed as the bastion of free speech.
</p>
<p>
    In these situations, using a VPN to unblock Twitter is the only way to stay abreast of the political commentary that
    regularly takes place on the popular platform. Without a VPN, people are dependent on their governments to unblock
    it, which can take months or even years to happen. And even if it does happen, not all content may be released.
</p>
<h4><b>What Are the Best VPNs for Twitter?</b></h4>
<p>
    There are loads of VPNs out there, so it’s important to choose one that will work effectively toward your goal:
    allowing you to use Twitter. To help you attain your goal, the VPN you choose will need to offer a fast connection
    and top-notch security features. And, a money-back return policy wouldn’t hurt either.

    Here are 5 of the best VPNs for Twitter that don’t compromise on speed, security, and customer satisfaction.
