    If you live in the UK, you’re undoubtedly familiar with BBC iPlayer, a television, video, and radio streaming
    service that’s offered by none other than the BBC. It originally launched in 2007, and while it’s undergone various
    changes and development throughout its 10+ years of existence, its core offering of internet streaming is available
    only to people located in the UK.

    Like any site that blocks content, the BBC uses geolocation technology to determine your IP address, and if you’re
    located outside the UK, it blocks you. The main reason for this is that BBC productions are funded by UK residents
    who pay the TV license fee; if you live outside the UK and stream shows from iPlayer, you’re essentially getting
    them for free.

    A VPN, or virtual private network, creates a private network across a public network, which results in additional
    security and browsing anonymity. The latter is the more popular reason for using a VPN among individual PC and
    mobile owners—it allows them to block their location and access geo-blocked sites, like BBC iPlayer, that they
    normally wouldn’t be able to access.
