    YouTube gets blocked by a lot of countries for a lot of reasons, including government censorship and explicit
    content. As a result, VPN services have had to work extra hard to overcome the various restrictions put on viewers
    because of copyright laws, ethical standards, and even national security. If you're an average person looking for
    some good content though, these restrictions are just bothersome, which is why VPNs for YouTube are such a relief.
    You can easily access and stream all of the content that's available on YouTube without any geo-restrictions or IP
    address limitations.

    The VPN effectively cloaks your IP address, so YouTube doesn't know where you're streaming from. This way, no
    restrictions are placed on your viewing enjoyment.
