<p>When you go online, hackers, cyber-thieves, or the perennially curious can easily gather your IP (Internet Provider)
    address and use it to see what sites you visit online and even to steal your private details. If you’d like to
    protect your privacy, the best and easiest way is to use a VPN, or Virtual Private Network. A VPN hides your
    internet activity in a ‘tunnel’ and encrypts the signals that your computer sends to the server.</p>

    You can set up a VPN on your computer easily, but you'll need to set up another one on your smartphone. And what
    about your smart home thermostat or wireless security system? With the advance of the Internet of Things, we have
    more home appliances that connect to the internet, each of them potentially hackable. The best way to secure all of
    your wireless-enabled devices is to install a VPN on your router. By protecting your router with a VPN, you can
    include every smart appliance and WiFi device within the same envelope of security by installing and configuring
    just one VPN.

<h4><b>What is a WRT Router?</b></h4>
<p>
    WRT stands for Wireless RouTer, but you’ll usually find it talked about as DD-WRT. DD-WRT is a type of Linux-based
    firmware for routers that effectively reconfigures them. When you buy your router, it comes configured to be easy to
    use by the average customer, but that also restricts the ways you can use the router—including stopping you from
    turning it into a VPN router. DD-WRT lifts those restrictions, so you can use a DD-WRT router as a VPN router.

<h4><b>What is a VPN Firewall Router?</b></h4>
<p>
    A VPN firewall router simply combines the benefits of a VPN, which encrypts your internet traffic, and a firewall,
    which protects your network from viruses, hackers, and other attacks on your router. A VPN firewall router is the
    best way to protect your privacy from every danger using both encryption and firewalls to keep out the risks of the
    internet.
