<h4><b>How to Set up VPN for fuboTV</b></h4>
<p>
    There are 2 steps to setting up a VPN for fuboTV: the first is setting up your VPN, and the second is setting up

            VPN</a> provider.</li>
    <li>Install the provider’s VPN app on the device you’ll be using to access fuboTV (i.e. Windows, Mac, Android, iOS,
        etc.) or browser extension if you prefer to stream through your computer (fuboTV recommends using Chrome).</li>
    <li>Follow the app’s set-up instructions for your chosen device.</li>
    <li>Connect to a VPN server in the United States or Canada. Most VPN providers offer hundreds of servers in

<h4><b>How to Unblock and Watch fuboTV Outside the US Using a Smart DNS Proxy</b></h4>
<p>
    Using a Smart DNS proxy is another way to unblock and access streaming services. A Smart DNS redirects the part of
    your connection that reveals the user’s location to the content provider, thus enabling users to access a service
    such as fuboTV from regions where it is blocked. To use a Smart DNS proxy to access fuboTV, simply sign up for a
    Smart DNS service that includes fuboTV in its list of unblocked channels.
