    While Amazon Video debuted in 2006, there’s no question that with each passing year it gets better and better. Not
    only is it available to Prime members for free, but it’s also available as a standalone service to people who aren’t
    Prime members. And of course, it comes with thousands of movies and TV shows, including Amazon’s own exclusive
    branded content.

<p>
    The only issue with Amazon Prime Video is that it’s only available to people located in the United States. Which
    means that if you travel abroad for a short time or live outside the US, you won’t be able to stream anything from
    your Prime Video account.

<h4><b>Using a VPN to Get Around Prime Video’s Geolocation Restrictions</b></h4>
<p>If you’re outside the US and can’t stream from your Prime Video account, using a VPN is an affordable, convenient,
    and secure solution. A VPN (virtual private network) encrypts your data and obscures your location, which means that
    people outside the US can connect to servers in the US and then access their Prime Video accounts.</p>
<h4><b>Which Devices Support Amazon Prime Video?</b></h4>
<p>If you love the idea of using a VPN to access Amazon Prime Video but are not sure what devices it will work on, don’t
    worry - Prime Video is available on almost every device under the sun, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Smart TVs</li>
    <li>PCs</li>
    <li>Blu-ray players</li>
    <li>Set-top boxes (Roku, Google TV, TiVo, Nvidia Shield)</li>
    <li>Amazon Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, Fire phone, Fire tablets</li>
    <li>Game consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Wii)</li>
    <li>Android devices (Prime Video app for Android phones and tablets)</li>
    <li>iOS devices (Prime Video app for iPhone, iPad &amp; iPod touch)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Bear in mind you’ll have to register each device with your Prime account. (More info on how to do this here.)
