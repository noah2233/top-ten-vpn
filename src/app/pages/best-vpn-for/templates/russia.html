    Putin has struck again with an updated VPN ban meant to increase the already tight censorship laws regulating
    Russian viewing and streaming. Many Russian citizens and organizations rely on VPNsâ€‹ to provide adequate anonymity
    so they can voice their political opinions freely without fear of repercussions. With a tighter ban on VPN usage,
    people fear that their right to be heard as well as their ability to access information contrary to what the
    government espouses will be removed.

    The latest updates are honing in on non-compliant VPN services as well as TOR providers in particular.
