    Putin has struck again with an updated VPN ban meant to increase the already tight censorship laws regulating
    Russian viewing and streaming. Many Russian citizens and organizations rely on VPNsâ€‹ to provide adequate anonymity
    so they can voice their political opinions freely without fear of repercussions. With a tighter ban on VPN usage,
    people fear that their right to be heard as well as their ability to access information contrary to what the
    government espouses will be removed.

<p>
    The latest updates are honing in on non-compliant VPN services as well as TOR providers in particular.

<h4><b>How to choose the best VPN for Russia</b></h4>
<p>
    Knowing which are the features to look for is half the battle of finding a good VPN for Russia. When browsing the
    options, be sure to get these all-important features
</p>
<p><strong>- Speed</strong></p>
<p>How fast a service lets you stream, download, and surf the internet will make a huge difference to the quality of
    your internet experience. Nobody wants to sit there for hours waiting for a single TV show to buffer. Fast speeds
    means a good VPN experience</p>
<p><strong>- Servers</strong></p>
<p>The amount of servers a VPN provider has will directly affect the speed with which you can work. So, more servers are
    better all the time. Additionally, the more locations in which a provider has servers, the more widespread your
    availability becomes. For example, if the content is geo-restricted to the UK, having servers in Bangladesh
    won&rsquo;t help you. Look for a VPN that has servers in all the major cities.</p>
<p><strong>- Privacy</strong></p>
<p>What kind of privacy policies does this service have? Does it keep logs? Disclose your IP data? Record activity
    sessions? Any of these would be an invasion of your privacy and an immediate reason to say no to a VPN provider.
    Find yourself a service that takes your privacy and anonymity seriously, ensuring a no-logging and no tracking
    policy as well.</p>
<h4><b>What sites/content is blocked in Russia?</b></h4>
<p>With the passing of the new law, there is going to be a lot more censorship and blacklisting going on around Russia
    than in previous years. Many services have already agreed to keep logs and identify users with a real name/identity.
    Additionally, there will be a lot more content blocked in the coming years including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Media and news sites</li>
    <li>LinkedIn (and Facebook recently got unbanned precariously)</li>
    <li>Certain social chatting apps</li>
    <li>Content viewed as extremist</li>
    <li>VPNs and proxies that don&rsquo;t comply with the new law</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else the Russian government deems inappropriate content for public viewing (for whatever reason political,
    financial, or otherwise.</p>
<h4><b>How to test a VPN for Russia</b></h4>
<p>Using a VPN, you can unblock any content even while sitting in the heart of Russia. The process is quick and easy:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sign up for a VPN service</li>
    <li>Set up your VPN according to your OS and browser specifications</li>
    <li>Turn on your VPN via the WiFi section on your computer</li>
    <li>Stream uncensored with ease</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>What are the Best VPNs for Russia?</b></h4>
<p>So, how do you find a good VPN for Russia? Whether you are visiting for business, on vacation, or some other reason,
    you&rsquo;ll need a reliable VPN provider if you want to access the websites you are used to visiting without a
    thought. There are some VPNs that will give you another IP address (outside of Russia), so geo-restrictions
    don&rsquo;t apply. These will, however, still channel the content through the Russian filters.</p>
<p>Of course, a VPN that simply opens up your content to that which the Russian government deems appropriate still
    isn&rsquo;t giving you the free-range access you are looking for. That&rsquo;s why you need to choose a top-rated
    VPN that will not only hide your location and identity but will open up all filters and circumvent the bans put on
    by the Russian government. Here are a few great choices that will deliver on this promise:</p>
