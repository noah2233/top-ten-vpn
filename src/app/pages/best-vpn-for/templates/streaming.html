    Streaming has become increasingly popular with the rise of digital media content such as shows, videos, and music.
    Unfortunately, depending on where you are located, certain types of content and sites may be restricted to you.
    We’ll explain what streaming is and how a top VPN can be the solution to accessing all the streaming you can handle.

<h4><b>Streaming 101</b></h4>

    Streaming is often confused with downloading, as they both essentially do the same thing – allow you to enjoy the
    content you love. Where they differ is in the way they deliver the content to your device. Streaming is when you
    consume media that’s playing in real-time. This means that the media is not saved on your device and you need
    internet access the entire time that the content is playing. Streaming speed depends on internet connection
    strength, which is why streaming is choppy at times. Downloading, on the other hand, is when the media file is
    transferred entirely to your computer, giving you access whenever you want, even without an internet connection.
</p>
<p>
    Streaming has risen in popularity due to the fact that it’s a safer way to consume content, as nothing is being
    stored on your computer, and it removes a lot of the hassle that comes with downloading. The media may be stored in
    a cloud or accessed by a media streamer. Either way, the file is available and requires no download or link-copying
    on your part.
</p>

    You can stream content anywhere, anytime, and on any device. No matter if you’re commuting to work, relaxing in the
    park, or running on the treadmill, streaming is generally quick, safe, and reliable.

<h4><b>Using a VPN to Stream</b></h4>
<p>
    You have likely heard of popular streaming devices like the Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku, or Smart TVs. All these are
    tools for streaming content directly on your TV.
</p>
<p>
    They’re really simple to set up. All you have to do is:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Turn on your TV</li>
    <li>Open the streaming feature</li>
    <li>Select the show or movie you want to watch</li>
    <li>Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show (literally).</li>
</ol>
<p>
    There are also online streaming websites like Netflix, YouTube, and Kodi that stream movies, series, and music
    directly to your phone or computer
</p>
<p>
    Common uses for streaming are of course to watch movies and series, but other content can be streamed like news
    programs and sporting events. After pressing play, the content gets streamed directly to your device in real-time.
    Keep in mind that you will need to have good internet connection so the content plays smoothly. This is especially
    true for high quality videos.
</p>
<p>
    Streaming enables anyone to consume any content they want, but many times content is restricted to certain
    geographic locations or countries, such as China. This is why streaming aficionados turn to VPN (virtual private
    network) solutions. Using a VPN to stream content allows you to “choose” your computer’s location for unrestricted
    access to content from around the world.
