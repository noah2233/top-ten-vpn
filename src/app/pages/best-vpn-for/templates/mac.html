    The conventional wisdom holds that if you’re working with a Macintosh you can rest easy when it comes to security.
    And while Mac and Apple devices are considered more secure and stable than their Windows counterparts, you should
    still consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to safeguard your privacy—not to mention to access all types of
    online content like Netflix and Hulu that may be blocked where you live. Most VPN companies offer dedicated Mac
    software, which is designed specifically for use with your Apple products.
