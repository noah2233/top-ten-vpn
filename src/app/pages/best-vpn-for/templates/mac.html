    The conventional wisdom holds that if you’re working with a Macintosh you can rest easy when it comes to security.
    And while Mac and Apple devices are considered more secure and stable than their Windows counterparts, you should
    still consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to safeguard your privacy—not to mention to access all types of
    online content like Netflix and Hulu that may be blocked where you live. Most VPN companies offer dedicated Mac
    software, which is designed specifically for use with your Apple products.

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> Hotspot Shield is the VPN of choice for more than 70% of the
                biggest security companies around the world. That should say a lot about how reliable this brand is for
                security. In terms of your privacy, Hotspot Shield does not keep IP address logs and switches IP
                addresses frequently. So, nobody, not snoopers or Hotspot Shield itself, can access your information.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Speed: </strong>Hotspot Shield also kills it in the speed department. It’s developed an original
                technology called Catapult Hydra that optimizes speed by using multiple server connections for stronger,
                faster connections, even over long distances. Hotspot Shield even has more servers than the ever-popular
                ExpressVPN, and it was rated as the fastest VPN service out there by PCWorld.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Service: </strong>Hotspot Shield seals the deal with its customer service. By offering
                24/7 support, Hotspot Shield ensures that you’ll always have someone there to help whenever you need
                them. Plus, Hotspot Shield's customer service is manned by tech staff, so you are reaching out to
                someone who knows what they're doing and can help fix the problem quickly and easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hotspot Shield is the cream of the crop when it comes to VPN security, convenience, and reliability. It
            offers up to 5 device connections, unlimited bandwidth, and some truly competitive pricing. For just a few
            bucks a month, you can get total malware protection and online security with just the click of a button.
            There’s even a free version if you’re not interested in paying and just want basic protection.</p>

        <p><strong>Why we love it:&nbsp;</strong><br> Aside from being #1 ranked in security, Hotspot Shield provides
            you with lightning fast connections and downloads. This makes it the ideal choice for anyone who loves
            streaming, downloading, and general P2P file sharing. You can access all of your favorite TV shows from
            anywhere, and you can enjoy them without those annoying hiccups that come from an iffy connection.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy and Security</strong>. <a href="/reviews/nordvpn">NordVPN</a>&#8203; uses double-data
                encryption technology and has a strict no-logging policy. It also utilizes an automatic kill switch that
                will instantly shut down the functions of your choosing in the event the VPN connection should fall,
                helping keep your Mac and Mac software safe.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed</strong>. Because of the high level of encryption, NordVPN does experience inconsistent
                speed at times. This can slow things down if you’re using your Mac to stream a TV show or watch a sports
                broadcast from across the world. That said, this depends largely on the location of the servers you’re
                using and NordVPN does not apply any speed or bandwidth limits to its users.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer service</strong>. On NordVPN you can contact a representative via live chat at any
                time, and receive a prompt response. You can also email customer service at any time and expect a
                response in up to 48 hours, according to the company. There is also an extensive knowledge base on the
                company website’s “help center.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There’s more to NordVPN’s app for Mac than just its beautiful design. It’s also a breeze to use. The app
            automatically selects the best server and includes a dedicated ping-o-meter which lets you monitor for
            performance issues in real time. You can also use it on up to 6 devices at the same time, meaning that your
            Mac and any iOS devices you have can be up and running securely in no time.

        <p>
            <strong>Why we love it:&nbsp;</strong><br>
            NordVPN gets a thumbs up for being easy to use, but their big selling point is security. With military grade
            encryption (which encrypts your data twice) strict no-logging, and a host of other features NordVPN has what
            it takes to keep your Mac safe.

                uses
                industry-grade TSL encryption standards and private servers. The company uses what it describes as
                “unbreakable
                AES
                256 protocol” for security</li>
            <li><strong>Speed</strong>. ZenMate touts its “turbo speed VPN” and “lightning fast speeds” and has done
                well in
                performance tests for streaming. The company does not put any bandwidth limits on users and allows for
                simultaneous
                connections on up to 5 devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer service</strong>. Zenmate has a customer support email where you can submit questions
                and
                receive a
                response from a company representative. Zenmate also advertises a 30-day money-back guarantee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When the company says “click and connect,” they mean it. ZenMate’s VPN can be downloaded and set up in just
            a
            minute
            and will launch automatically whenever you power up your laptop. ZenMate also works on up to 5 devices at
            once,
            so
            after you’ve downloaded ZenMate VPN for Mac, you can also get it set up on your iPad, iPhone, really
            anywhere
            that
            you have a Mac or iOS device.

            <strong>Why we love it:&nbsp;</strong><br>
            ZenMate is a great choice for anyone, but especially if you’re looking for a headache-free, easy to set up
            VPN
            solution. In addition, the VPN comes with a number of added security features for your Mac, including
            tracking
            protection and ad-blocking. It also has some added features for business owners, including encrypted VoIP
            calling
            and the ability to conduct international quality assurance without having to be physically present in
            another
            country.

                internet kill switch which will log you off automatically if the VPN stops working. The company also
                keeps no record of your browsing activities or connection logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed</strong>. Independent testing of PureVPN has shown it to have reliably fast connection
                speeds and download times, and the company bills itself as the “world’s fastest VPN service.”</li>
            <li><strong>Customer service</strong>. PureVPN has a 24/7 live chat for customer service and you can also
                check out the company website’s FAQ and user forums to get answers. PureVPN also has an entire section
                of their website devoted to tutorials on using a VPN.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Another top notch service, the PureVPN Mac app uses 256-bit encryption and works in multiple languages,
            including Dutch, German and French. You can also support 5 separate, simultaneous logins, meaning you can
            support a whole household of Mac users with a single VPN account.

            <strong>Why we love it:&nbsp;</strong><br>
            Speed isn’t everything—but it sure helps. PureVPN is consistently ranked one of the fastest VPNs available,
            which is great if you love to stream TV shows or just to have a smooth, unbroken connection for your Mac.
            Not only that, but if you’d like a little extra juice, you can also purchase add-ons that boost your
            connection speed by up to 20Mbps.
