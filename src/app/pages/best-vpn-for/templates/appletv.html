    Apple began as one of the pioneers in computer technology, and today, it seems like anything the company touches
    turns to gold—computers, smartphones, and one of its more recent developments, streaming media players, also known
    as Apple TV.
</p>
<p>
    Apple TV streaming is brilliant; it’s a tiny box that you plug into the HDMI port on your TV, and it then allows you
    to connect to the internet and watch shows and stream movies on your television screen.

<h4><b>Why Use a VPN With Apple TV Media Player?</b></h4>
<p>As awesome as it is, even Apple TV has its limitations. Because it uses the internet to allow you to stream TV shows,
    it means that you’re limited to shows offered in your location
</p>
<p>
    For people living in the United States, this is not necessarily the biggest problem, but for people living outside
    the U.S., or vacationing abroad, this can be extremely limiting, since sites like Netflix and Hulu block users
    outside of the U.S.
</p>
<p>
    This is when using a VPN with Apple TV can come in handy. A VPN adds an additional layer of security to private and
    public networks, such as a corporate network or WiFi hotspot. But because VPNs work by replacing a user’s initial IP
    address with one from the VPN provider, these networks also allow users to block their locations. In the case of
    Apple TV, using a VPN allows people to access internet content that would otherwise be blocked in their locations.
</p>
<p>So if you live in the U.S., but go vacationing abroad, you can use a VPN with your Apple TV to log into your
    <strong>Netflix</strong> account and access all your favorite shows and channels. Or if you live outside the United
    States, you can use a VPN with your Apple TV to access geo-blocked sites like <strong>Hulu</strong> or
    <strong>MTV</strong>.</p>
<p>While using a VPN for Apple TV isn’t necessary, it sure can make your life a lot more entertaining.</p>
<h4><b>Setting Up a VPN for Your Apple TV</b></h4>
<p>
    Because Apple TV doesn’t support built-in VPNs, it means that you’ll need to configure the VPN on your router in
    order for it to work. It may sound complicated, but it’s actually pretty simple, and only takes a few minutes.While
    the setup procedure will vary slightly depending on the VPN you choose, the main gist of it is the same.
</p>
<p>
    Here’s how to set up a VPN for your Apple TV:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the website of your VPN provider and log into <strong>My Account</strong>. You’ll then have the option of
        <strong>setting up the VPN on your devices</strong>—click on Apple TV.</li>
    <li>You’ll get a <strong>DNS server IP</strong>—that’s your SmartDNS, which hides your actual location. Save that
        number.</li>
    <li>If you live outside the U.S., go to your Apple TV and head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
        <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Apple TV Language</strong>, and change your iTunes store location to
        United States. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Head back to <strong>General Settings</strong> (or start from here if you live in the U.S.). Go to
        <strong>Network</strong> &gt; <strong>WiFi</strong> &gt; <strong>Configure DNS</strong>. Make sure you click on
        Manual instead of Automatic.</li>
    <li>Input the <strong>DNS server IP</strong> that you get from your VPN.</li>
    <li>Go back to <strong>Settings</strong> on your Apple TV, scroll down until you find <strong>Restart</strong> (not
        Reset).</li>
    <li><strong>Test your VPN</strong> by trying to log onto <strong>Hulu</strong> or <strong>Netflix</strong>. In most
        cases, it should work. If you can’t log on, contact customer support. In most cases, it’s simply an issue of
        changing the server or port.</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Choosing Which VPN to Use with Apple TV</b></h4>
<p>
    Setting up a VPN with your Apple TV is nothing compared to actually choosing which VPN to use. Because VPNs use
    sophisticated technology that the average Joe is not familiar with, most people have only the company’s website and
    review to rely on.
</p>
<p>
    While it’s good to take a look at the company’s website to get an idea of how professional it is and the products
    they have on offer, reading VPN reviews is your best tool for deciding which VPN to choose.
</p>
<p>
    When reading reviews of VPNs, here are some things to look out for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Will it work with Apple TV?</li>
    <li>Is the VPN fast?</li>
    <li>Is it secure?</li>
    <li>How much does it cost?</li>
    <li>How responsive is customer support?</li>
    <li>Is there a trial or money-back guarantee?</li>
</ul>
