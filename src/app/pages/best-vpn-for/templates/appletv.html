    Apple began as one of the pioneers in computer technology, and today, it seems like anything the company touches
    turns to gold—computers, smartphones, and one of its more recent developments, streaming media players, also known
    as Apple TV.
</p>
<p>
    Apple TV streaming is brilliant; it’s a tiny box that you plug into the HDMI port on your TV, and it then allows you
    to connect to the internet and watch shows and stream movies on your television screen.

<h4>Why Use a VPN With Apple TV Media Player?</h4>
<p>As awesome as it is, even Apple TV has its limitations. Because it uses the internet to allow you to stream TV shows,
    it means that you’re limited to shows offered in your location
</p>
<p>
    For people living in the United States, this is not necessarily the biggest problem, but for people living outside
    the U.S., or vacationing abroad, this can be extremely limiting, since sites like Netflix and Hulu block users
    outside of the U.S.
</p>
<p>
    This is when using a VPN with Apple TV can come in handy. A VPN adds an additional layer of security to private and
    public networks, such as a corporate network or WiFi hotspot. But because VPNs work by replacing a user’s initial IP
    address with one from the VPN provider, these networks also allow users to block their locations. In the case of
    Apple TV, using a VPN allows people to access internet content that would otherwise be blocked in their locations.
</p>
<p>So if you live in the U.S., but go vacationing abroad, you can use a VPN with your Apple TV to log into your
    <strong>Netflix</strong> account and access all your favorite shows and channels. Or if you live outside the United
    States, you can use a VPN with your Apple TV to access geo-blocked sites like <strong>Hulu</strong> or
    <strong>MTV</strong>.</p>
<p>While using a VPN for Apple TV isn’t necessary, it sure can make your life a lot more entertaining.</p>
