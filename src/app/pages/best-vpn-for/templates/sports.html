    You’ve got your team, the rivalries and the games that make you think of home, family, and those legendary victories
    that will live on after we’re all gone. The problem is, it can be hard to follow all the action if you’re not in the
    right city or region. If you’re overseas, the local broadcaster may not carry the games—if they’ve even heard of
    say, college football to begin with.

    The struggle is real - but these days you’ve got a trick up your sleeve that can bring just about any sports
    broadcast into your living room, no matter where you are.
</p>
<h4><b>What’s a VPN?</b></h4>
<p>
    A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tool that hides your computer’s IP and allows you to hook up to servers in
    locations across the world, so you can access content that is blocked in your country.
</p>
<p>A VPN can protect you from eavesdropping and most people may be familiar with the technology because of the way it’s
    been used to help dissidents stay a step or 2 ahead of the authorities in non-democratic countries. In such
    countries a VPN also allows people to access websites that are blocked by the authorities, giving them a window to
    the outside world and a way to communicate with each other without leaving digital footprints.</p>
<p>When it comes to sports broadcasting, licenses are typically sold and secured on a country by country basis, so if
    you're not located in a certain country, you probably won't be able to access the local streaming service. This is
    where a VPN comes in.</p>
<p>
    If for instance, the BBC has an exclusive contract to broadcast a specific sport or team in the UK, that license
    probably won’t extend to other countries. Instead, you can use your VPN to change your computer’s IP to a UK-based
    server, and stream the content as if you were in jolly old England.
</p>
<h4><b>Why Use a VPN to Watch Sports</b></h4>
<h5><b>Multiple Simultaneous Connections</b></h5>
<p>VPNs can allow you to run several different connections at the same time. So if for instance its college bowl season,
    or the Olympics, or just any given Sunday, you can show one game on your PC and different ones on your other mobile
    devices. Not only does this mean you can keep up with all the action, but it also allows you to watch on the move,
    no matter where you are.</p>
<h5><b>Security</b></h5>
<p>By masking your IP, VPNs help you secure your connection and protect yourself from a data breach or other online
    threats. Many services also will automatically block dangerous websites. If you’re streaming sports online, this can
    help keep you safe.</p>
<h5><b>The Content is Blocked or Unavailable in Your Country</b></h5>
<p>This would be the main benefit and/or reason to use a VPN to watch sports. Simply put, many sports broadcasts are
    only available in certain areas, and with a VPN you can access them no matter where you are.</p>
<h5><b>How to Watch Sports with a VPN</b></h5>
<p>PNs are designed to be easy to use. If you want to watch a sporting event using your VPN, first find a VPN provider
    that has the features and price you’re looking for. Make sure to also read some online reviews to get an idea of the
    quality and versatility of the product first.</p>
<p>Once you've found the VPN you prefer, sign up and install it on your computer and/or mobile device. This should have
    you up in running in a few minutes at most. Once you're there, search around online and find where the game you want
    to watch is being streamed for free. Then use your VPN and search for a server in the country where the game is
    being broadcast, and connect with it. Then go online and start streaming from the site that’s showing the game.</p>
<p>
    It’s really about as straightforward as can be.
