<p>These days, smart TVs are becoming more affordable and useful. If you use one to access Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and
    other streaming apps, you may be looking for ways to access more content and keep your privacy. That’s where a <a
        href="/">top VPN</a> can help.</p>
<p>While there’s more than enough content on smart TVs to last you a lifetime (or even several lifetimes), it’s often
    geographically restricted and leaves you open to attack from hackers or nefarious government agencies.</p>
<p>This means you may not be able to watch your favorite sporting events unless you live in a particular location – and
    even if you catch the game you don’t know who had access to your personal data while you were watching.</p>
