<p>These days, smart TVs are becoming more affordable and useful. If you use one to access Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and
    other streaming apps, you may be looking for ways to access more content and keep your privacy. That’s where a <a
        href="/">top VPN</a> can help.</p>
<p>While there’s more than enough content on smart TVs to last you a lifetime (or even several lifetimes), it’s often
    geographically restricted and leaves you open to attack from hackers or nefarious government agencies.</p>
<p>This means you may not be able to watch your favorite sporting events unless you live in a particular location – and
    even if you catch the game you don’t know who had access to your personal data while you were watching.</p>

<h4><b>Can I Install a VPN on My Smart TV?</b></h4>
<p>
    While installing a VPN on your laptop or mobile device is normally a question of downloading and installing an app,
    the situation is a bit more complex on a smart TV.
</p>
<p>
    To date, there’s no way you can install a VPN on your smart TV directly. That said, you can still use a VPN with
    your smart TV via one of two methods: 1) setting it up on a router; or 2) sharing your connection via your laptop or
    mobile device.
</p>
<h4><b>Setting Up a Router</b></h4>
<p>Setting up a VPN on your router is probably the least straightforward option, but it’s also the one that gives you
    the most flexibility.</p>
<p>If your VPN is installed on a router, every device that connects to your home Wi-Fi network automatically connects to
    your VPN. This means you only have to set your VPN up once. As an added bonus, you’ll be able to use your VPN
    simultaneously on as many devices as you want, irrespective of whether the VPN provider restricts simultaneous use
    to a limited number of devices.</p>
<p>
    You can install a VPN on most routers manually. The best VPN services on the market have support sections on their
    website that detail how to go about this step by step. Once the VPN is up and running on your router, simply connect
    your smart TV via Wi-Fi and that’s it. You’re all set!
</p>
<h4><b>Sharing your Connection</b></h4>
<p>
    If installing a VPN on your router isn’t possible (or a bit too technical for your taste), sharing your connection
    with your smart TV via your laptop or mobile device is the next best thing. In this scenario, your laptop or mobile
    device acts as the source of your smart TV’s internet connection. Because the VPN is installed on your device, it’s
    automatically shared with your smart TV too.
</p>
<p>
    Start by installing the VPN on your device. This is usually a question of downloading the app from your VPN
    provider’s website. Next, you need to allow other devices to connect to your device’s internet connection. Depending
    on whether you’re on Windows or Mac, you’ll find this option in the Control Panel or in System Preferences.
</p>
<p>
    Your VPN provider should also have detailed instructions on their website. Once that’s done, simply connect your
    smart TV to your device using an Ethernet cable; and you’re good to go.
