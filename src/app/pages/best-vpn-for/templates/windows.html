    Internet users all over the world are increasingly relying on virtual private networks (VPNs) to browse safely,
    anonymously, and to get around content restrictions in certain countries. All the leading VPN providers offer
    separate applications for the main operating systems, including Windows and Mac. If your computer runs on Windows
    10, Windows 7, or any other Windows version, youâ€™ll need to choose a VPN download for Windows to ensure your virtual
    network runs smoothly on your device.
