    Internet users all over the world are increasingly relying on virtual private networks (VPNs) to browse safely,
    anonymously, and to get around content restrictions in certain countries. All the leading VPN providers offer
    separate applications for the main operating systems, including Windows and Mac. If your computer runs on Windows
    10, Windows 7, or any other Windows version, you’ll need to choose a VPN download for Windows to ensure your virtual
    network runs smoothly on your device.

    <h4><b>Why Do I Need a VPN for Windows?</b></h4>
    <p>Whether your device runs on Windows or any other operating system, there are a number of reasons to use a VPN.
        These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security</strong>. VPNs provide a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and the
            internet, meaning nobody can see your personal IP address, place malware on your computer, or steal your
            data. This is a particularly important consideration when using public Wi-Fi, where your security can easily
            be compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Bypassing geographic restrictions</strong>. Many websites block or restrict content to certain
            locations. If you find yourself posted abroad for work, you can still
            access restricted content
            with a VPN. Traveling outside the US, but don’t want to miss your favorite Netflix show? Just use your VPN
            to connect to a US IP address, and problem solved.</li>
        <li><strong>Surfing without worry</strong>. These days, even citizens of the free world have a hard time knowing
            whether someone’s snooping on their internet usage. But with a VPN, you can browse safely, knowing that
            nobody – not governments, not corporations, not even the owners of the website you last visited – can find
            out your real IP address or identity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><b>How to Set up a VPN on Windows 10 - Step-By-Step</b></h4>
    <p>There are 2 ways to set up a VPN on Windows 10. For new users who prefer to connect in seconds and to not mess
        around with the security settings, the best way is to download the Windows app from your VPN provider’s website.
        For users who don’t mind spending an extra minute connecting manually and choosing their own security settings,
        just follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Right-click the Lan/Wi-Fi icon on the bottom-right of your screen, and select Network &amp; Internet
            Settings.</li>
        <li>Select VPN from the menu on the left.</li>
        <li>Click the plus symbol next to the words “Add a VPN connection.”</li>
        <li>Choose Windows (built-in) as your VPN provider. Type in your connection name and server name or address. You
            can find these names from your VPN provider’s list of servers. You’ll also need the name and password you
            use for your VPN service to proceed. Don’t forget to click “Remember my sign-in info” if you wish to log in
            automatically the next time. When you’re done filling in all these details, click “Save.”</li>
        <li>Now you’ll see your chosen VPN connection on the list of VPN options. Just click on it to connect.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><b>How to Set up a VPN on Windows 7 - Step-By-Step</b></h4>
    <p>Windows 7 users can also connect in seconds with their VPN provider’s Windows app. To set up manually, just
        follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Right-click the Lan/Wi-Fi icon from the system tray on the bottom right of your screen, then select “Open
            Network and Sharing Center.”</li>
        <li>Click “Select a new connection or network.”</li>
        <li>Select “Connect to workplace” and click Next.</li>
        <li>Select “Use my Internet connection (VPN).”</li>
        <li>Insert your preferred server address and destination name (from the list of servers given by your VPN
            provider), your destination name. Choose whether to “allow other people to use this connect.” And choose
            whether to connect now or just set up the VPN so you can connect later. Once you’re done, click Next.</li>
        <li>On the next screen, enter the username and password you use for your VPN account. Tick “Remember this
            password” if you wish to do so, and then click Create.</li>
        <li>To choose your own security settings, click on Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings.
            Right click your newly created VPN connection and select Properties. Click on the Security tab (third from
            left) and choose your preferred type of security protocol and data encryption.</li>
        <li>Your VPN connection will now appear in your control panel under Network and Internet &gt; Network
            Connections. Simply right-click on the VPN and select Connect.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><b>How to Test Your Windows VPN</b></h4>
    <p>To test the speed of your Windows VPN connection, simply connect to a server and begin browsing. Most paid
        services offer a 7-day or 30-day money-back guarantee, to protect you if you’re not satisfied with the speed or
        with any other features.</p>
    <p>Another thing to be aware of is WebRTC IP leaks. WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile
        applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities, but it can open you up to having your real IP
        address leaked. All the top VPN providers have tools in place to prevent this from happening. If you wish to
        check for yourself, most providers have a page on their website where you can conduct a leak test. Simply
        disconnect from your VPN and open the page in a new tab or window. Take note of any public IP addresses you see.
        Close the page. Connect to your VPN and re-open the page. If you still see any of the public IPs you saw
        earlier, you have suffered a privacy leak. You can also conduct this test using a free IP address check from the
        likes of whatismyipaddress or whatismyip.
    </p>
    <p>Most VPN providers also offer instructions on how to turn off WebRTC and block out even the smallest risk of an
        IP leak.</p>
    <h4><b>Can I Get a Free Windows VPN?</b></h4>
    <p>Some VPN companies offer free or trial subscriptions, but remember that you get what you pay for. Free VPN
        services are usually slower, less reliable, and limited to a small amount of bandwidth that last just a few
        hours or days. If you’re away from home for a couple of days and just need a temporary fix for your Windows
        device, then you might find a free VPN a suitable option. But if you’re looking for a permanent solution, then
        we recommend paying a few dollars a month for a subscription from a secure and reliable VPN service.</p>
    <h4><b>VPN for Windows Server</b></h4>
    <p>Windows includes a built-in option to function as a VPN server using PPTP, the point-to-point tunnelling
        protocol. This is a useful option for people who wish to connect to their home network on the road, play video
        games on the same network as friends in other locations, or secure their browser while on a public connection.
        This option is best for advanced users, as it can open your computer up to potential security risks when not
        done properly.</p>
    <p>To create your VPN server in Windows 10, just follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center and click “Change adapter settings.” For a shortcut, just
            hit the Windows icon (on Windows 10) or Start, and type“ncpa.cpl.”</li>
        <li>Open the File menu (by pressing Alt on Windows 10, or by looking at the tabs at the top of the Control Panel
            on Windows 7). Select “New Incoming Connection.”</li>
        <li>Tick all the users who you want to establish VPN access for on this computer. Click Next.</li>
        <li>Tick “Through the Internet” and click Next.</li>
        <li>On the next page, you’ll be given a choice of networking software. Select Internet Protocol Version 4
            (TCP/IPv4) and click “Allow access.” Windows will configure your VPN server access within a few seconds.
        </li>
    </ol>
