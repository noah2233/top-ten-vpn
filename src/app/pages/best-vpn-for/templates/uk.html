    Whether you live in the UK or you’re just passing through for a short period of time, there are many reasons to use
    a VPN to access the internet there. Many Brits don’t realize it, but the government has the power to snoop on all
    their browsing activity. And what’s more, some of the world’s most popular websites and streaming services still
    restrict content to the UK to this very day. With a VPN, or virtual private network, you can get around both these
    problems and view whatever content you want without your internet service provider (ISP) or the British government
    knowing.

<h4><b>Update on the UK&rsquo;s Snooping Powers</b></h4>
<p>At the end of 2016, the UK began implementing the Investigatory Powers Act, or &ldquo;Snoopers&rsquo; Charter,&rdquo;
    which gave the British authorities some of the strongest surveillance powers of any democracy. Among other things,
    the law requires communication service providers &ndash;</p>
<p>including ISPs and phone companies &ndash; to retain British internet users&rsquo; browsing records for 1 year. This
    data includes the records of every website user&rsquo;s visit. The British Court of Appeal ruled earlier this year
    that a previous, stronger surveillance law was illegal. However, no ruling has been made on the Snoopers&rsquo;
    Charter currently in effect, and therefore the only protection for British internet users is to use a VPN.</p>
<h4><b>How to Choose the Best UK VPN?</b></h4>
<p>One of the main things to look out for when choosing a VPN provider is that it offers the right protections for
    UK-based users. The VPN provider should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain a strict zero-logging policy, meaning it doesn&rsquo;t keep any records of your browsing history.</li>
    <li>Offer servers in many different locations around the world, so that you can view all types of geo-restricted
        content.</li>
    <li>Offer super-fast servers, so you can enjoy even higher speeds than your British ISP can offer.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Which Sites are Blocked in the UK?</b></h4>
<p>The UK blocks most, if not all, of the well-known file-sharing, torrenting and streaming websites. These include <a
        href="/best-vpns-for-pirate-bay">The Pirate Bay</a>, Movie2k, EZTV,
    FilesTube, Putlocker.</p>
<p>In addition, many websites and streaming services restrict what you can view from the UK. For example, Netflix is
    very popular in the UK, but due to various licensing agreements it doesn&rsquo;t allow UK-based viewers to watch
    everything that its US-based viewers can see. With a VPN, you can connect to a US server from the UK, and Netflix
    will treat you as if you were viewing from Los Angeles or New Orleans and not from London or Edinburgh.</p>
<h4><b>Is it Legal to Use a VPN in the UK?</b></h4>
<p>The simple answer is: yes, VPNs are completely legal in the UK. To date, only autocratic states such as <a
        href="/best-vpns-for-china">China</a>, <a href="/best-vpns-for-russia">Russia</a>, Iran and Belarus have
    attempted
    to ban VPNs, but even they are finding this difficult to implement. While there has been some speculation the UK
    will attempt a VPN ban in future, there is no evidence to suggest the British government will actually attempt such
    a move.</p>
<h4><b>Which VPNs to Avoid in the UK</b></h4>
<p>As in any country, it&rsquo;s best to stick to the best and most reputable VPNs. While it&rsquo;s tempting to save
    money and use a free VPN service, this is only really suitable if you&rsquo;re planning to be in the UK for a couple
    of days and just want a free service to get around geolocation restrictions on Netflix, YouTube or other streaming
    sites. Overall, free services are usually slower and less reliable and give you limited bandwidth, whereas the <a
        href="/">top paid VPN services</a> &ndash; such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN
    give you reliability.</p>
<h4><b>How to Test a UK VPN</b></h4>
<p>To test your new UK VPN, simply log on to your chosen VPN provider from wherever you are in the UK, then connect to a
    server in your chosen country (it could be the UK or elsewhere &ndash; the choice is yours) and begin browsing. Most
    of the top VPN services offer a 7-day trial or 30-day money-back guarantee to try them out.<br /> One thing to be
    aware of when using a VPN is the small potential for leaks. WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers
    and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications capabilities, but it can open you up to having your real IP
    address leaked. All the best VPN providers have tools in place to prevent this happening. For peace of mind, you can
