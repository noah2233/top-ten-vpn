    Whether you’re an avid online gamer or just play once in awhile, you should be using a VPN. A virtual private
    network - or VPN - has several benefits, least of which is the peace of mind that comes with knowing your most
    sensitive data is protected.
</p>
<p>
    That said, not just any VPN will do. You probably know that online games use up a lot of bandwidth; and a fast and
    stable connection is essential if you want to make the get the most out of your action-packed battles.
</p>
<p>
    So what should you look for in a VPN for online games? And which is the best VPN for gaming on the market today?
</p>
<h4>
    <b>
        Why Do I Need a VPN for Online Games?
    </b>
</h4>
<p>
    There are three main reasons you should use a VPN for online gaming: 1) security; 2) performance; and 3) to bypass
    geographic restrictions.
</p>
<h5><b>VPN for Gaming and Security</b></h5>
<p>
    Most online games these days work on a subscription model. You need to create an online account, join or be a member
    of an online community or otherwise provide some form of online verification. Whichever the case, you’ll have to
    provide sensitive data, including your credit card details, in order to play.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, online gaming accounts are appealing to cyber criminals. Not only do they contain financial and other
    personal information, they’re also relatively easy to hack. Throw in an unsecured WiFi connection; and it’s almost
    as if you’re opening the door and inviting them in.
</p>
<p>
    A VPN encrypts your data and passes it through a secure private server. This makes it much harder for hackers to
    gain access. It also shields you from DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks.
</p>
<h5><b>VPN for Gaming Performance</b></h5>
<p>
    A slow connection not only makes gameplay incredibly frustrating, it can also be the difference between completing a
    mission successfully or not.
</p>
<p>
    In the past, online gamers avoided VPNs precisely because of the adverse effect they could have on performance.
    However, these days, VPNs have improved by leaps and bounds. Many VPNs now have features specifically designed to
    improve your connection’s speed and overall performance.
</p>
<p>
    Using a VPN can significantly enhance gameplay. In particular, switching to a server that’s closer to the game’s
    main server decreases the amount of time needed for data transfers, which minimizes lag and other speed issues.
</p>
<p>
    Some VPNs also have features designed to bypass your internet service provider’s speed restrictions. This ensures
    your online gaming experience remains smooth, irrespective of how much bandwidth you’re using.
</p>
<h5><b>Geographic Restrictions</b></h5>
<p>
    Many online games have geo-restricted features, which means you can only access them if you live in a certain
    location. Some games (Battlefield 4, for instance) are even banned completely in some countries.
</p>
<p>
    A good VPN allows you to bypass these restrictions by switching to a server in a different country. You can also get
    additional benefits, including early bird access to new features that are as yet unavailable where you live. If
    you're looking to unblock Minecraft, Fortnite, or any other popular games, you'll need a VPN.
</p>
<h4><b>What Should I Look for In a VPN for Gaming?</b></h4>
<p>
    There are three features you should consider above all else in a VPN for online gaming: 1) security; 2) speed and
    reliability; and 3) the number of servers.
</p>
<h5><b>Security</b></h5>
<p>
    The best VPNs for online games have strong security features which shield your sensitive information and protect you
    from hacking attempts. In particular, you should look out for the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>strong encryption (256-bit encryption is the gold standard);</li>
    <li>OpenVPN support; and</li>
    <li>a strict no logging policy, which means the VPN doesn’t collect data about your internet usage. Reputable VPN
        providers should detail their logging policy in their terms and conditions, so read them carefully.</li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Speed and Reliability</b></h5>
<p>
    For starters, you’ll want unlimited bandwidth and no speed caps. Online gaming uses up a lot of bandwidth, so VPNs
    with speed and bandwidth caps or traffic management policies just won’t cut it. You’ll also want a VPN whose servers
    guarantee at least 99.99% uptime. This greatly reduces the chances of the server crashing during a crucial section
    of gameplay.
</p>
<h5><b>Number of Servers</b></h5>
<p>
    The more servers available in different countries, the greater your geo-unblocking options. It also makes it easier
    for you to shorten the distance between your location and the game’s main server, which reduces lag and other
    connection problems.
