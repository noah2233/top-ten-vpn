            <h2>VPN Protection: Can I Hide My IP Address?</h2>
            <p>
                A VPN encrypts and protects your
                data connection online. What you do online is open for prying eyes, but you can protect and hide your IP
                address and data by using a VPN. A VPN secures data between you and your business, or you can obtain
                anonymity and protection for your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>There are loads of VPNs to choose from; and quality is on the rise. The process of choosing a VPN starts
                with a realistic assessment of your needs: if – for example - you only use Apple products, you must find
                the best VPN for Mac and Apple products.
            </p>
            <h2>How VPN Connections Benefit You</h2>
            <p>Not everyone has the same priorities, or uses the internet in the same way. If you want to improve
                anonymity online, VPN providers give you a way to discreetly access the Internet through a “tunnel”
                service. This type of access masks your communication and displays the VPN’s IP address when you
                connect to a website, instead of your own.</p>
            <p>This means that your private home IP address is hidden when browsing different websites. Using a VPN
                service will likely impact your computer speed as well. If you are looking for a fast VPN, make sure
                that it
                also keeps your privacy through data encryption between your computer and the target server. By using a
                VPN,
                you can improve the protection of your data, and stay anonymous on the internet – all while streaming or
                browsing at top speeds.
            </p>
            <p>Other benefits of VPN are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast streaming and downloading/torrenting</li>
                <li>Access geo-restricted content</li>
                <li>Anonymous web surfing</li>
                <li>Bypass VPN blocks</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Price Matters - But Only up to a Point</h2>
            <p>Free VPNs may seem attractive on paper, but they often offer a sub-par service and may have significant
                privacy issues. Always keep in mind that&nbsp;free services are free for a reason. The best VPNs offer a
                balance between quality and price, and some can be really cheap.</p>
            <h2>Speed and Reliability</h2>
            <p>
                A VPN keeps you safe online by rerouting your traffic through an encrypted server. If this process is
                done well, the effect on your connection should be unnoticeable. If, on the other hand, the VPN is poor
                quality, it may grind your internet speed down to a halt.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are looking for the best VPN for streaming, for example, look out for services with 99.9% uptime
                and no speed or bandwidth caps. This ensures your online experience will be smooth - irrespective of how
                heavy your internet usage is.
            </p>
            <h2>How VPN Connections Benefit Your Business</h2>
            <p>
                Businesses big and small also benefit from setting up VPN connections. VPN allows employees who are
                working from home to connect to a private network over the internet while still protecting their IP
                addresses. A VPN service gives protection to the business and the employee. The software is typically
                installed on
                the employee’s computer, and the employee uses the service to perform daily tasks as if the employee is
                logged in locally.

                            <p>
                                There’s a lot to say about CyberGhost’s VPN service. For starters, it’s got great speeds
                                and performed stupendously on every speed test. In fact, CyberGhost touts an average of
                                47 Mbps globally. That’s a great average. What’s more, this company allows you to access
                                Netflix and other popular TV and movie streaming sites, so you can enjoy HD streaming
                                from anywhere.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We like CyberGhost’s competitive pricing plans that offer you a single month for $11.99,
                                but quickly heaps on the savings for bulk month ordering. For 6 months, you'll save 58%,
                                and for 12 months, you'll get a 77% savings! But, that isn't even the most impressive
                                part. In addition to low pricing, CyberGhost has a 30-day money-back guarantee, which is
                                certainly nice, but it gets better. If you are super commitment-phobic, you can try out
                                CyberGhost totally free for 7 days. No questions asked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In case privacy is important to you, CyberGhost has you covered. For one thing, it has a
                                no logging policy, and when it says no logs, it means it. There is no logging of any of
                                your online activity at any time.

                            <p>
                                NordVPN may not have the number one spot, but it is a very close second. In fact, there
                                are some areas that it might even pull ahead of its rival ExpressVPN for the coveted
                                crown. For starters, it is super easy to use, allows torrenting, and ranks highly on all
                                speed tests. That already makes NordVPN an attractive option, but its fabulously low
                                monthly pricing plan really seals the deal for most people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                NordVPN has a lot of excellent feature members love. For example, you get top of the
                                line security features from this company including a kill switch that automatically
                                shuts down your session when the connection is not secure. You can choose between a
                                single app kill switch or a full system kill switch, too. NordVPN also offers IP hiding,
                                so your identity is safe with them. Don’t forget the double VPN servers that encrypt
                                your data twice for added security.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                NordVPN also gives you up to 6 simultaneous connections, so you don’t have to worry that
                                your daughter, roommate, or co-worker is eating up all of your streaming time. Possibly
                                the most impressive fact is that NordVPN sports a whopping 3,350 servers across 64
                                countries. Wow! Find out how NordVPN can help you stay secure and surf happily today.

                        <p>
                            Some VPNs apps actually carry malware and do poor encryption. They may also log user data in
                            order to safeguard their network. Look for a VPN with solid user ratings and a high security
                            ranking, as well as a strict no-logging policy. Also, keep in mind that a paid account
                            usually provides a more reliable service than a free one.

                        <p>
                            Once you’re hooked up to a VPN your internet service provider (ISP) cannot see which sites
                            you visit, the data you send or receive or the apps you use, because all of it is encrypted.
                            That said, the VPN provider itself may keep a record of your online data and there is always
                            the outside chance that the VPN network itself could be hacked.

                        <p>
                            If you’re out and about using public WiFi, a VPN can encrypt your connection and help keep
                            you safe. It can also keep your private data safe from hackers. A VPN doesn’t do much though
                            to protect you from malware and viruses, so you must make sure that you also add strong
                            cybersecurity software as well.
